# Explanation

I am getting much more into puzzles, and I want to pursue creating them on the web in fun ways, hopefully even using the tech to create new puzzle types. This will be the repo where I do that, stick around!

# Steps

To run this, just clone the repo, cd into it, and run `http-server` (you might need to install in via npm if you haven't already). Then navigate to localhost:8080/index.html

# Misc

If you're curious how I picked the colors for this, I used the colors of the MTA in New York! Robin's egg blue is announced for the upcoming T line! Read more: https://www.6sqft.com/did-you-know-the-mta-uses-pantone-colors-to-distinguish-train-lines/
